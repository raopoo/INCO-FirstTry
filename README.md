Welcome to Mr Coffee's website. This is the 1st project from the INCO Academy where the layout and resources where provided and I had to replicate the given design. 
This project was completed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. No frameworks were used. 
Making the website responsive without using frameworks like bootstrap was a challenge. 
I got the opportunity to learn and understand how flexbox and grids work in CSS. 
I was successfully able to implement media queries to make the site responsive. 
I would like to improve the project by making an hamburger menu for the navbar in CSS.
