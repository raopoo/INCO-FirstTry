Welcome to Mr Coffee's website. This is the 1st project from the INCO Academy
where the layout and resources where provided and I had to replicate the given design. 

This project was completed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. No frameworks were used. 

Making the website responsive without using frameworks like bootstrap was a challenge.

I got the opportunity to learn and understand how flexbox and grids work in CSS. 

I was successfully able to implement media queries to make the site responsive. 

The project was made in 2 parts. The task in the 1st part was to replicate an exsisting design. 
The 2nd part was involved in creating a form, providing validation for it, and displaying a message
using a modal. 

I would like to improve the project by making an hamburger menu for the navbar in CSS.
